# HousePoints: Family Chore Management System

## Product Overview

HousePoints is a family chore management system that helps parents and kids track household tasks using a points-based reward system. Currently in active use by our founding family, the platform makes chore completion engaging through gamification while teaching kids responsibility and time management.

## What HousePoints Does

HousePoints transforms the daily challenge of getting kids to do their chores into an engaging experience. Kids earn points for completing tasks, which they can trade for rewards, privileges, or screen time. The system includes achievement badges, streak bonuses, and even allows siblings to trade chores with each other.

## Key Features

### For Parents

- Set up rotation groups for recurring tasks
- Approve chore trades between kids
- Manage reward store and redemptions

### Family Kiosk Dashboard
A wall-mounted touchscreen display shows today's chores, family presence, weather, and announcements. The kiosk provides a central hub for the family to check responsibilities and coordinate activities.

- Are comfortable with technology
- Can provide constructive feedback

Beta families receive free access during testing and discounted pricing at launch.

## Why We Built HousePoints

As parents ourselves, we experienced firsthand the daily struggle of chore management. Existing solutions were either too simple (basic charts) or too complex (enterprise task management). HousePoints fills this gap with a system designed specifically for family dynamics.
