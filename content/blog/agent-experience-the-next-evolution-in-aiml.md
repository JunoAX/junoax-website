## Choosing the Right Tech Stack for Your Small Business

When starting or scaling a small business, choosing the right technology stack is crucial. But with endless options and aggressive vendor marketing, it's easy to get overwhelmed or overspend. Here's our practical guide based on real client experiences.

### Start Simple, Scale Smart

**The Golden Rule:** Choose boring technology that works. The latest JavaScript framework might be exciting, but established tools have better documentation, more developers, and fewer surprises.

### Essential Categories for Small Business

#### 1. **Website & Online Presence**
**Budget Option:** WordPress on shared hosting ($10-30/month)
- Perfect for content sites and basic e-commerce
- Thousands of themes and plugins
- Easy to find help

**Growth Option:** Static site with Netlify/Vercel (Free-$20/month)
- Lightning fast performance
- Virtually unhackable
- Scale to millions of visitors

**When You're Ready:** Custom application on AWS/Google Cloud
- Full control and flexibility
- Pay only for what you use
- Requires technical expertise

#### 2. **Email & Communication**
**Start with:** Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 ($6-12/user/month)
- Professional email addresses
- Document collaboration
- Video conferencing included

**Avoid:** Self-hosted email (too much maintenance and deliverability issues)

#### 3. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
**Free Start:** HubSpot CRM or Zoho CRM free tiers
- Track customer interactions
- Basic sales pipeline
- Email integration

**When to Upgrade:** When you need automation, advanced reporting, or have 10+ users

#### 4. **Accounting & Finance**
**Non-negotiable:** QuickBooks or Xero from day one
- Don't try to DIY accounting
- Integrates with banks and payment processors
- Makes tax time manageable

#### 5. **Development Tools (If Building Software)**
**Version Control:** GitHub or GitLab (free for small teams)
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI (included)
**Monitoring:** Free tiers of Datadog, New Relic, or Sentry

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Over-engineering Early**
Don't build for a million users when you have ten. That's a good problem to have later.

**2. Vendor Lock-in**
Always have an exit strategy. Can you export your data? Switch providers?

**3. Ignoring Total Cost**
Consider not just subscription fees but:
- Training time
- Integration costs
- Maintenance requirements
- Scaling costs

**4. Following Big Company Playbooks**
What works for Fortune 500 doesn't work for 5-person teams.

### Real Client Example

A local retail client came to us with:
- 5 different subscription services for email
- Custom-built inventory system that barely worked
- No proper backups
- $800/month in unnecessary tools

**What we implemented:**
- Consolidated to Google Workspace ($60/month)
- Moved to off-the-shelf inventory system ($100/month)
- Automated backups to S3 ($10/month)
- **Result:** Saved $630/month and everything actually worked better

### The 80/20 Stack

For most small businesses, this stack covers 80% of needs:

**Basic Operations:**
- Google Workspace or Microsoft 365
- QuickBooks or Xero
- WordPress or Squarespace for web presence
- Stripe or Square for payments

**Growing Business Add-ons:**
- HubSpot or Pipedrive for CRM
- Slack for team communication
- Zapier for automation
- Calendly for scheduling

### When to Get Help

Consider consulting help when:
- Making decisions that are expensive to reverse
- Integrating multiple systems
- Dealing with compliance requirements
- Planning major migrations

### Your Action Plan

1. **Audit Current Tools:** List everything you're paying for
2. **Identify Redundancies:** What tools do similar things?
3. **Check Usage:** Are you actually using all features?
4. **Plan Consolidation:** Can fewer tools do more?
5. **Set Review Schedule:** Reassess every quarter

### Bottom Line

The best tech stack is the one you'll actually use. Start simple, choose proven solutions, and upgrade when you have real pain pointsâ€”not hypothetical ones.
