## The New Reality of Remote Work

Three years after the pandemic changed everything, remote work isn't going away. But many small businesses are still using cobbled-together solutions that create more problems than they solve. Here's your practical guide to doing it right.

### The Core Tools You Actually Need

**Communication: Keep It Simple**
- **Primary:** Slack (free for small teams) or Microsoft Teams (included with Office 365)
- **Video:** Zoom (still the most reliable) or Google Meet (free with Workspace)
- **Avoid:** Having too many communication channels - pick one and stick to it

**Document Collaboration**
- **Google Workspace** ($6/user/month): Docs, Sheets, Drive - everything syncs automatically
- **Microsoft 365** ($6/user/month): If you're already in the Microsoft ecosystem
- **Don't:** Email documents back and forth - that's 2010 behavior

**Project Management**
- **Simple teams:** Trello (free) or Notion (free for small teams)
- **Growing teams:** Asana or Monday.com when you need more structure
- **Reality check:** Spreadsheets work fine for many small teams

### Security Non-Negotiables

**1. VPN for Public WiFi**
Your team will work from coffee shops. Accept it and protect them:
- NordVPN or ExpressVPN for business (~$5/user/month)
- Or set up WireGuard on a small VPS (technical but cheaper)

**2. Password Manager (No Excuses)**
- Bitwarden Business ($3/user/month)
- 1Password Business ($8/user/month - better for families)
- Enforce use through policy, not hope

**3. Device Management**
For company devices:
- BitLocker (Windows) or FileVault (Mac) - both free
- Find My Device enabled
- Remote wipe capability set up

### The Home Office Reality

**What to Provide/Reimburse:**
- Laptop/computer (obviously)
- Second monitor ($150-300)
- Decent headset ($50-100)
- Monthly internet stipend ($50)

**What's Nice but Optional:**
- Standing desk
- Ergonomic chair
- Ring light for video calls

### Common Mistakes We See

**Mistake 1: Over-tooling**
You don't need 15 different apps. Most small teams need 5-6 core tools maximum.

**Mistake 2: No documentation**
Create a simple "Remote Work Playbook" - one document with all the key info:
- Which tools to use when
- How to report technical issues
- Working hours expectations
- Security requirements

**Mistake 3: Assuming everyone's technical**
Not everyone intuitively knows how to use these tools. Budget time for training.

### Internet Redundancy Plans

Because home internet fails at the worst times:
- Phone hotspot as backup (ensure plans have enough data)
- List of nearby locations with reliable WiFi
- Consider a backup internet service for key employees

### Making Meetings Not Suck

**The Rules That Actually Work:**
1. Camera on for small meetings, optional for large ones
2. Mute when not talking (always)
3. Record important meetings for those in different time zones
4. "No meeting Fridays" or similar blocks for deep work

### Monitoring Without Being Creepy

**Do:** 
- Track project completion
- Regular check-ins
- Clear deliverables

**Don't:**
- Install keystroke monitors
- Require constant "green light" status
- Micromanage

### Budget Reality Check

**Per Employee Monthly Costs:**
- Communication tool: $0-15
- Cloud storage: $6-12
- Password manager: $3-8
- VPN: $5-10
- **Total: $14-45/month per person**

That's less than one day of office coffee and parking.

### Quick Wins for Next Week

1. **Monday:** Audit your current tools - what's actually being used?
2. **Tuesday:** Set up password manager for the team
3. **Wednesday:** Create communication guidelines
4. **Thursday:** Test everyone's backup internet plan
5. **Friday:** Document everything in one place

### The Bottom Line

Remote work doesn't require enterprise solutions. It requires thoughtful selection of simple tools, clear communication, and basic security. Start with the essentials, add tools only when you have a specific problem to solve.
