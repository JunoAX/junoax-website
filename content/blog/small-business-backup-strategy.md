## Your Data Will Disappear. Be Ready.

Last week, a client called in tears. Their bookkeeper's laptop died with three months of unbacked-up QuickBooks data. Another client discovered their "backup" had been failing silently for six months. These aren't rare stories—they're weekly occurrences.

Here's a backup strategy that actually works because it's simple enough to stick with.

### The 3-2-1 Rule (Small Business Edition)

Everyone quotes "3-2-1" but here's what it really means for small businesses:

**3 Copies:**
1. Working copy (your computer)
2. Local backup (external drive or NAS)
3. Cloud backup (the lifesaver)

**2 Different Media:**
- Your computer + cloud (different media ✓)
- Or computer + external drive (different media ✓)

**1 Offsite:**
- Cloud backup (offsite ✓)
- Or drive at owner's house (offsite ✓)

### Priority 1: What Must Be Backed Up

Start here. Get these right before worrying about anything else:

**Critical (Backup Daily):**
- QuickBooks/accounting files
- Customer database
- Current project files
- Email (if not in cloud already)

**Important (Backup Weekly):**
- Documents folder
- Desktop (yes, people still save there)
- Shared drives
- Website files

**Nice to Have (Monthly):**
- Software installers
- Old projects
- Archive emails
- System settings

### The Realistic Backup Plan

**Option 1: The Simple Cloud-First Approach**
- **Primary:** Google Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive ($10-20/month)
- **How:** Sync folders automatically
- **Pros:** Set and forget, accessible anywhere
- **Cons:** Slower for large files, ongoing cost

**Option 2: The Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- **Local:** Synology NAS or external drive ($200-500 one-time)
- **Cloud:** Backblaze ($7/computer/month)
- **How:** Time Machine/Windows Backup + Backblaze agent
- **Pros:** Fast local restore, offsite protection
- **Cons:** More setup initially

**Option 3: The Budget Approach**
- **Local:** External USB drive ($50-100)
- **Cloud:** Google Drive free tier (15GB)
- **How:** Manual weekly backups + critical files in cloud
- **Pros:** Minimal cost
- **Cons:** Requires discipline, limited space

### Software That Makes It Automatic

Because manual backups don't happen:

**Windows:**
- Built-in: File History (free, basic)
- Better: Veeam Agent (free, powerful)
- Best: Acronis Cyber Backup (paid, comprehensive)

**Mac:**
- Built-in: Time Machine (free, reliable)
- Better: Carbon Copy Cloner (paid, more control)
- Best: Backblaze (paid, set-and-forget)

**Cross-Platform Cloud:**
- Backblaze ($7/month): Unlimited, truly automatic
- Carbonite ($72/year): Good for small offices
- IDrive ($80/year): Best value for multiple computers

### Testing Your Backups (The Part Everyone Skips)

**Monthly 5-Minute Test:**
1. Pick a random file from last month
2. Try to restore it
3. Can't find it? Your backup isn't working
4. Document the test (seriously, write it down)

**Quarterly Disaster Drill:**
1. Pretend your main computer died
2. Try to restore a critical file to another computer
3. Time how long it takes
4. Fix whatever made it hard

### Real-World Backup Schedules

**For the Solopreneur:**
- Continuous: Cloud sync for documents
- Daily: Automated backup to external drive
- Weekly: Verify backups are running
- Monthly: Test restore one file

**For the 5-Person Office:**
- Continuous: Cloud sync for active projects
- Nightly: Server backup to NAS
- Weekly: Full backup to cloud
- Monthly: Test restore, rotate offsite drive

**For the Retail/Restaurant:**
- Real-time: POS system cloud backup
- Daily: QuickBooks backup
- Weekly: Security footage archive
- Monthly: Full system backup

### Backup Mistakes That Will Hurt You

**Mistake 1: "RAID is a backup"**
RAID protects against drive failure, not deletion, corruption, or ransomware.

**Mistake 2: "It's in the cloud, so it's backed up"**
If you delete it locally, it deletes from cloud. You need versioning.

**Mistake 3: "The IT guy handles it"**
When did you last verify? Can you restore without them?

**Mistake 4: "We backup to the server"**
If the building burns down, so does your server.

### Ransomware Reality Check

Your backup is your only real defense against ransomware:
- Use versioning (keep 30+ days of versions)
- One backup should be "air-gapped" (disconnected)
- Test restore procedures before you need them
- Have a plan for "backup is encrypted too" scenario

### Quick Wins for This Week

**Monday (10 minutes):**
- Check if your current backup actually ran
- Look at what's being backed up

**Tuesday (30 minutes):**
- Set up cloud sync for critical folders
- Or buy an external drive

**Wednesday (20 minutes):**
- Configure automated backup
- Set calendar reminder to check monthly

**Thursday (10 minutes):**
- Test restore one file
- Document where backups are

**Friday (5 minutes):**
- Tell someone else where backups are
- Celebrate having real backups!

### The Cost of Not Backing Up

**Real client losses from this year:**
- Dental office: $12,000 (recreating patient records)
- Law firm: $8,000 (reconstructing case files)
- Retail shop: $5,000 (lost inventory data)
- Restaurant: $15,000 (POS data corruption)

**Your backup budget:** $10-100/month

The math is obvious.

### Emergency Recovery Contacts

Before disaster strikes, know who to call:
1. Your backup software support
2. Local IT support (us: consulting@junoax.com)
3. Data recovery service (expensive last resort)
4. Your insurance agent (check your coverage!)

### The Bottom Line

Perfect backup strategies don't matter if they don't get done. Pick something simple, automate it, test it monthly, and sleep better knowing your business can survive a hard drive failure.

Start today. Seriously, right now. Set up one automated backup. Your future self will thank you.
