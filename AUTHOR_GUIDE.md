# JunoAI Innovations Author & Image Guidelines

## Author Personas

To maintain professional separation while appearing as a legitimate company, use these author attributions:

### Primary Authors

1. **JunoAI Team** - Use for general company updates, announcements, and technical overviews
2. **Alex Chen** - Security and infrastructure posts (already used for cloud security post)
3. **Sarah Kim** - Data analytics and business strategy posts (already used for predictive analytics)
4. **Founder/Anonymous** - Only for personal stories about HousePoints development

### Author Guidelines

- **Never use your real name** except for the HousePoints origin story (already updated to be anonymous)
- **Rotate authors** to create variety
- **Keep it simple** - Don't create elaborate backstories
- **Use "JunoAI Team"** for most posts to avoid complexity

## Image Recommendations

### Current Images to Replace/Update

Replace these stock AI/tech images with more appropriate ones:

1. **ai-network-graphic.png** - Currently used for "Tech Stack" post
   - Replace with: Simple office/computer setup or tool icons
   - Source suggestion: Unsplash business/office category

2. **ai-automation.jpg** - Generic AI image
   - Replace with: Small business workspace or team collaboration
   - Avoid: Futuristic AI visualizations

3. **future-ai-business.jpg** - Used for AI automation post
   - Replace with: Practical automation tools (Zapier, workflows, etc.)
   - Keep it grounded in reality

4. **data-analytics.jpg** - Used for predictive analytics
   - Replace with: Simple dashboard or spreadsheet view
   - Avoid: Complex data visualizations

5. **cloud-security.jpg** - Keep this, it's appropriate for security content

### Recommended Image Sources (Free & Safe)

- **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - Free, high-quality
- **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Free stock photos
- **Undraw** (undraw.co) - Simple illustrations
- **Font Awesome Icons** - For simple graphics

### Image Guidelines

1. **Avoid futuristic AI imagery** - No robots, neural networks, or sci-fi visuals
2. **Focus on practical business** - Office spaces, computers, simple tools
3. **Use real-world scenarios** - People working, families (for HousePoints)
4. **Keep it professional but approachable** - Not too corporate, not too casual

### For HousePoints Specifically

Consider adding:
- Family kitchen/home scenes
- Chore charts or task lists
- Kids doing chores (happy, not forced)
- Family tablet/kiosk mockups
- Simple reward charts

## Blog Post Strategy

### Keep These Posts (Already Updated)
1. **Building HousePoints Journey** - Personal story, now anonymous
2. **Cloud Security for Small Business** - Practical, by "Alex Chen"
3. **Choosing the Right Tech Stack** - Practical advice, by "JunoAI Team"

### Consider Removing/Archiving
1. **The Future of AI Automation** - Too ambitious, might conflict with day job
2. **Predictive Analytics** - Too theoretical for a small consulting firm

### Future Post Ideas (Safe Topics)
- Small business IT tips
- Remote work technology setup
- Basic cybersecurity for families
- HousePoints updates and features
- Client success stories (anonymized)
- Tool reviews and comparisons

## Final Recommendations

1. **Remove your name** from all public content except where already anonymized
2. **Use "JunoAI Team"** for 60% of posts
3. **Use fictional names** for 30% (Alex Chen, Sarah Kim)
4. **Keep 10%** anonymous (Founder posts)
5. **Update images** to be less "AI-focused" and more "small business focused"
6. **Archive overly ambitious posts** that might conflict with your PM role

This approach makes JunoAI look like a small but professional team while protecting your day job identity.
